# Overview of SeaState python driver
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script serves as a Python driver for the SeaState library. It demonstrates
# how to interact with the main subroutines of SeaState.
#
# NOTE: This script serves as a template and can be customized to meet
# individual requirements.
#
# Basic algorithm for using SeaState python library:
#   1. Initialize the Python wrapper library:
#      - Set necessary library values
#      - Load input file data (from file/script)
#   2. Initialize the SeaState Fortran library:
#      - Call seastate_init once
#      - Handle any resulting errors
#   3. Sample call at a few different times/positions 
#      - Set array of positions
#      - Call seastate_calcoutput and handle errors
#      - Return resulting velocities array
#      - Aggregate output channels
#   4. call a few other interface routines to check if they work
#FIXME: finalize names after interface finalized a bit more
#      - GetWaveFieldPointer
#      - get_fluidVelAccDens for a few points
#   4. Finalize:
#      - Call ifw_end to close library and release resources
#      - Handle any resulting errors
